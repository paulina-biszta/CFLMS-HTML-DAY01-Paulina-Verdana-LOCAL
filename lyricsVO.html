	<h1>If I Had A Heart</h1>

<div>
	<pre>
This will never end 'cause I want more
More, give me more
Give me more

This will never end 'cause I want more
More, give me more
Give me more

If I had a heart I could love you
If I had a voice I would sing
After the night when I wake up
I'll see what tomorrow brings
	</pre>
</div>

<div class="chorus">
	<pre>
Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah
If I had a voice, I would sing
	</pre>

</div>
<div>
	<pre>
Dangling feet from window frame
Will I ever ever reach the floor?
More, give me more, give me more

Crushed and filled with all I found
Underneath and inside Just to come around
More, give me more, give me more
	</pre>
</div>

<div class="chorus">
	<pre>
Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah
If I had a voice, I would sing
	</pre>
</div>
