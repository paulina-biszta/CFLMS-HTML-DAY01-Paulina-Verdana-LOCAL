	<h1>If I Had A Heart</h1>

<p><pre>
<div>This will never end 'cause I want more
More, give me more
Give me more</div>
<div>This will never end 'cause I want more
More, give me more
Give me more</div>
<div>If I had a heart I could love you
If I had a voice I would sing
After the night when I wake up
I'll see what tomorrow brings</div>
<div class="chorus">Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah
If I had a voice, I would sing</div>
<div>Dangling feet from window frame
Will I ever ever reach the floor?
More, give me more, give me more</div>
<div>Crushed and filled with all I found
Underneath and inside Just to come around
More, give me more, give me more</div>
<div class="chorus">Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah
If I had a voice, I would sing</div>
</pre></p>
