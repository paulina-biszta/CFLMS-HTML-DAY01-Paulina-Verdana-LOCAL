	<div> 
		<p> I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down </p>
		<p> I need your loving, loving I need it now </p>
		<p> When I'm without you, I'm something weak </p>
		<p> You got me begging, begging I'm on my knees </p>

	 <span> <pre> [Pre-Chorus] </pre> </span>

	 <div> 
	 	<p> I don't wanna be needing your love </p>
		<p> I just wanna be deep in your love </p>
		<p> And it's killing me when you're away </p>
		<p>Ooh baby </p>
		<p> 'Cause I really don't care where you are </p>
		<p> I just wanna be there where you are </p>
		<p> And I gotta get one little taste</p>

	<div>
		<p> Sugar, yes please </p>
		<p> Won't you come and put it down on me? </p>
		<p> I'm right here, 'cause I need </p>
		<p> Little love, a little sympathy </p>
		<p> Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright </p>
		<p> Need a little sweetness in my life </p>
		<p> Your sugar, yes please </p>
		<p> Won't you come and put it down on me?</p>

	<div> 
		<p> Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up </p>
		<p> Don't leave me hanging, hanging </p>
		<p> Come give me some </p>
		<p> When I'm without you, I'm so insecure </p>
		<p> You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for </p>
